Lagentry – Enterprise AI Agents Platform

A comprehensive knowledge base for SMEs in the MENA region

1. Introduction
Lagentry is an enterprise-grade AI agents platform built to help small and mid-sized businesses deploy production-ready AI employees instantly. The platform was originally launched as a no-code AI agent builder but evolved after recognizing that most businesses do not want to design agents from scratch. Instead, they want immediate value. Lagentry now offers ready-made, pre-trained AI agents that require minimal to no setup.

Lagentry is designed with a strong focus on the MENA region, supporting Arabic-first, multilingual communication while remaining globally scalable. It enables businesses to automate operations, improve customer experience, and scale efficiently without increasing headcount.

2. Platform Vision & Philosophy
Lagentry is built on a simple philosophy: businesses should be able to deploy AI the same way they hire employees. No technical complexity, no long onboarding cycles, and no fragmented tools. Each AI agent on Lagentry behaves like a professional employee with a clear role, defined responsibilities, and the ability to interact with systems and customers.

The platform prioritizes reliability, professionalism, and enterprise readiness. Unlike generic chatbots, Lagentry agents are trained for real business workflows, making them suitable for production use from day one.

3. Core Platform Capabilities
• Plug-and-play AI agents with no-code setup
• Pre-trained domain-specific intelligence
• Custom proprietary Large Language Model (LLM)

4. AI Agent Architecture
Each Lagentry agent is powered by a proprietary Large Language Model optimized for business workflows. Agents operate with structured reasoning, contextual memory, and tool execution capabilities. They can retrieve information, make decisions, and perform actions across connected systems.

Agents are deployed with guardrails, ensuring compliance, accuracy, and controlled behavior. Human escalation and override mechanisms can be configured where required.

5. Voice Calling Agents
Lagentry offers enterprise-grade voice calling agents capable of handling inbound and outbound calls. These agents can speak naturally, understand caller intent, and respond in real time. Voice cloning enables businesses to maintain brand consistency across voice interactions.

Use cases include sales outreach, customer support hotlines, appointment confirmations, lead qualification, and follow-ups. Voice agents operate 24/7 and scale instantly.

6. AI Agents by Domain
Recruitment & HR: Candidate screening, interview automation, scheduling, HR policy assistance.
Sales: Lead qualification, follow-ups, pipeline automation, meeting booking.
Customer Support: FAQ handling, issue resolution, ticket creation, escalation.
Finance: Invoice reminders, reporting, auditing, financial query handling.
Real Estate: Property inquiries, lead qualification, viewing scheduling.
Healthcare: Appointment scheduling, patient queries, reminders.

7. Integrations & Automation
Lagentry integrates with over 1000 platforms including CRMs, ERPs, databases, messaging platforms, email systems, and internal tools. Agents can execute actions such as creating tickets, sending emails, updating records, and triggering workflows.

8. Security, Privacy & Compliance
Lagentry is built with enterprise-grade security, including encryption, access control, data residency options, and compliance with global data protection standards. The platform ensures businesses maintain full control over their data and AI behavior.

9. Pricing & Plans
Lagentry offers a free trial to allow businesses to experience the platform. Paid plans start at $20 per month and go up to $100 per month. Annual subscriptions include two months free, providing cost-effective scaling.

10. Why Lagentry
